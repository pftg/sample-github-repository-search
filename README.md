# Sample App To Search GitHub Public Repositories 

Make a simple web app where you can display public repositories from github based on search term provided.
It can be a super simple page with input field on the top of it. Results can be shown right under the input.
We expect it to be written in the way so that it could go in production and maintained by your team mates - 
please have in mind that we use Ruby. Its up to you how you want to write it, and libraries you want to use, etc.

# Trade-offs

* No pagination
* No TDD

# Solution

Added simple example how to use model linked to remote API data. Thread-safe connections.
